# 3. Write a program that includes a method called multiply that takes two arguments and returns the product of the two numbers.

def multiply(num1, num2)
  num1 * num2
end

puts multiply(3, 4)

# I'm still outputting the return value of the multiply method, but irb shows a return of nil because that's the return value of the puts method.
