# 6. What does the following error message tell you?

# ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
#   from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
#   from (irb):4
#   from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

# I think it means that there is a mismatch between the number of parameters in a method definition on line 1 and the number of arguments passed into the method call on line 4 for the 'calculate_product' method. There was only 1 argument given though there are 2 parameters in its method definition.
