# 3. What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

# Exception handling is giving your program an alternative to crashing or stopping without running so that it can continue on and run.

# "Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility of an error occurring in a program. It is a way of handling the error by changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely."
