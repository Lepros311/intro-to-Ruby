# 7. What does the following error message tell you?

# SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
#   from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

# I think the error above means that there is an unnecessary closing parenthesis inside of a code block sometime before the block's closing curly bracket.

# edit: The error also indicates that the problem is on line 2.
