# 1. Add two strings together that, when concatenated, return your first and last name as your full name in one string. For example, if your name is John Doe, think about how you can put "John" and "Doe" together to get "John Doe".

first_name = "Andrew"
last_name = "Strickland"

puts "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
