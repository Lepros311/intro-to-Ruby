# 6. You run the following code...

names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'

# ...and get the following error message:

# TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
#   from (irb):2:in `[]='
#   from (irb):2
#   from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

# What is the problem and how can it be fixed?

# brackets after an array name expects to have an integer that represents the index. Instead, this is giving a string. The way to fix it is to give the index number, presumably 3 which is the index number for 'margaret'.
